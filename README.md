# peripherals-kinetic-platform
This repository contains all integrations related to integrating from Kinetic, to Kinetic. The Kinetic Platform leverages the same framework used to integrate to other systems that it does to integrate back to itself. 

## Kinetic Platform Overview
Kinetic Data is an Enterprise Workflow platform that connects human and technology interactions across systems of record at scale. Built on the core tenets of security, scalability and flexibility, prospects are empowered to transform their entire organization into a highly efficient, automated reality that reduces workload, cost of service delivery and risk. Technically savvy users leverage Kineticâ€™s framework and tools to build out applications and introduce workflow automation which solve thorny, complex problems at scale. 

### Integration Use Cases
- Within a workflow, if you need to create an approval, you'd use a Kinetic Platform integration that creates a submission within a form
- If you're building a Form within Kinetic that should shource data from another Form, you'd use the Kinetic Platform Bridge Adapter
