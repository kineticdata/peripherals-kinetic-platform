== KineticRequest_Submission_FormatAnswers_HTML
Builds an HTML table by formatting a specified subset of answers for
the specified Kinetic Request submission.

To specify the answers to be formatted, any of the following can be configured
(the answers will be sequenced in the normal page order of their corresponding
questions):
* A starting question question name ("Question" in the authoring console) (if the starting question is not provided, the
  first question of the service item will be used).
* An ending question question name ("Question" in the authoring console) (if the ending question is not provided, the
  last question of the service item will be used).
* A comma separated list of question question names ("Question" in the authoring console) to explicitely include
  (questions included in this list will be included even if they do not exist
  between the starting and ending questions).
* A comma separated list of question question names ("Question" in the authoring console) to explicitely exclude
  (questions included in this list will not be included, even if they exist
  between the starting and ending questions, or were specified in the 'Included
  Questions' parameter).

This handler will format the results in an HTML table for which you can control all
the styling, but the basic format is as follows:
  Answers:
  QUESTION_LABEL: ANSWER
  ...
  QUESTION_LABEL: ANSWER
  
There are also options to include the name of the template at the top of the table 
and a review request link below the table.

=== Parameters
[Starting Question]
  The question name ("Question" in the authoring console) of the first question that should be formatted.  If this is
  left blank, the first question on the service item will be used.
[Ending Question]
  The question name ("Question" in the authoring console) of the last question that should be formatted.  If this is
  left blank, the last question on the service item will be used.
[Included Questions]
  A comma separated list of question question names ("Question" in the authoring console) that should be explicitely
  included in the question list.  Questions included in this list will be 
  included even if they do not exist between the starting and ending questions.
  Whitespace matters; ensure there are no spaces after a comma separating the
  question names(unless the question name includes a preceding space).
[Excluded Questions]
  A comma separated list of question question names ("Question" in the authoring console) that should be explicitely
  excluded in the question list.  Questions included in this list will be
  excluded even if they exist between the starting and ending questions or are
  included in the 'Included Question' parameter.  Whitespace matters; ensure
  there are no spaces after a comma separating the question names (unless the
  question question name includes a preceding space).
