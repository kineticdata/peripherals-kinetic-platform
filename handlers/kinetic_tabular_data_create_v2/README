=== Detailed Description
Saves the data from a json string created from an HTML table into a Remedy
form for future reporting and/or processing. To see how to create the data 
to feed into this handler, please see the community article here: 
http://community.kineticdata.com/10_Kinetic_Request/Solutions/Putting_Answers_into_YUI_Tables.

Each row in the table will be saved as one record in this form. One result 
is the row count of the rows of data saved. The other is the instance IDs 
of the record for each row. This allows for looping through the rows without
having to do a find handler if you want to loop through every row in the table.

The format of the XML of request IDs returned is:

<request_ids>
	<request_id>000000000000001</request_id>
	<request_id>000000000000002</request_id>
</request_ids>

The format of the XML of instance IDs returned is:

<instance_ids>
	<instance_id>AG00505696001CJTK_UQ8h_IBgSCAE</instance_id>
	<instance_id>AG00505696001CJjK_UQ5CDIBgSyAE</instance_id>
</instance_ids>

This handler can be used to store data for reporting. The Associated Request GUID
(Originating ID) is a required field, but the Template Name and Instance ID are 
not. Note that this data may be required by your reporting process if you want
to report on data by template, rather than just by individual record.
