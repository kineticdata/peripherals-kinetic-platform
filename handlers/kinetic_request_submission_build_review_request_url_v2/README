== KineticRequest_Submission_BuildReviewRequestUrl
Builds and returns the URL that corresponds to a review request view of the
desired Kinetic Request submission.

For more information, see the Detailed Description section below.

=== Requirements
* Kinetic Task v1.0.2+

This handler requires that the 'Source 2 ID' field on the 'KS_TSK_Relationship'
form be greater than 55 characters.  Prior to Kinetic Task v1.0.2, this field
had a limit of 50 characters.  As a workaround, the character limit for this
field can be expanded to 64 characters.

=== Parameters
[Submission Id]
  The instance id of the Kinetic Request submission that will be displayed by
  the review request.
[Configuration Type]
  When set to 'Simple', all review request parameters are defaulted.  When set
  to 'Advanced', optional review request parameters are exposed.

*Advanced Configuration Parameters*
The following parameters are only available when the 'Configuration Type'
parameter is set to "Advanced".
[Review Page]
  The path to the desired review request page (which should be set if the review
  request should use a specific theme).  If this value is blank, the default
  review request page will be used.
[Load All Pages]
  If true, all pages in the request are loaded at once. If false, the contents
  of the first page will be displayed, and the other content pages will be
  displayed as tabs.
[Excluded Pages (Name)]
  Comma separated list of page names to exclude from the review.
[Excluded Pages (Number)]
  Comma separated list of page numbers to exclude from the review (index starts
