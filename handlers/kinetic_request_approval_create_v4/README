== KineticRequest_Approval_Create
Creates an approval submission for the submission record specified by the
'Lookup Id' parameter, typically the Instance Id of the originating base
request.

This will trigger the Kinetic Request approval process, sending out an email
formatted based on the specified 'Message Template Name' parameter to the
approver.  This email typically includes a direct link to the approval, which
can be followed to display the Approval Template specified by the 'Approval
Template Name' parameter.

=== Detailed Description
The approval submission record, stored in the KS_SRV_CustomerSurvey_base form,
is created to interact with the Kinetic Request approval process (see the
Request Manager Training Manual for more information on Kinetic Request 
approvals).  This handler retrieves the submission record that has an 'Instance
Id' that matches the 'Lookup Id' parameter and copies the data necessary to
execute the Kinetic Request approval process.
* Copies the 'Lookup Id' parameter into the 'Lookup Value Id' field.
* Copies all of the attribute field values.
* Copies various required core fields (including 'ApplicationName',
  'AssigneeGroup', 'Category', 'CategoryInstanceID', 'Company ID',
  'Company Name', 'Data_Set', 'Form', and 'Survey_Method').
* Copies the OriginatingID and OriginatingID_Display fields from the originating
  submission record.
* Sets the 'Originating Form' field to the value of the Suvey_Template_Name on
  the originating submission record.
* Sets the 'Submission Type' field to "Approval".
* Sets the 'ng_EndpointSecret' field to the deferral token of this task.
* Sets the MessageTemplateInstanceID to the Instance Id of the message template
  (KS_MSG_MessageTemplate records, configurable from the Service Catalog
  Console) that was specified by the 'Message Template Name' parameter.
* Sets the SurveyInstanceID field the the Instance Id of the service item that
  was specified by the 'Approval Template' parameter.
* Maps the following approval field values from the specified info values:
  - 'ValidationStatus'     => "Initial Validation Status"
* Maps the following approval field values from the specified parameters:
  - 'Contact Info Value'   => "Approver Email"
  - 'First Name'           => "Approver First Name"
  - 'Last Name'            => "Approver Last Name"
  - 'Submitter'            => "Approver Login"
  - 'Survey Template Name' => "Approval Template Name"
