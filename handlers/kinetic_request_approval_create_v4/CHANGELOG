KineticRequest_Approval_Create_V4 (2014-12-08)
* Added new 5.2 fields. NOTE: This is NOT backwards compatible.

KineticRequest_Approval_Create_V3 (2013-08-17)
* Removed 'Approval Question Label', 'Approval Value', and 'Denial Comments Label'
  parameters.  These were in place for old Kinetic Request workflow that
  automatically created task triggers when the approvals were completed.
  Now the task engine is used to create these triggers therefore these values
  are obsolete.
* Removed the 'Notes For Customer' parameter, it is not commonly used in newer
  implementations.
* The 'Message Template Name' parameter is no longer required when configuring
  this handler.  If no message template is specified the Approval record
  will need to be set to a "Sent" status manually for most portal pages to
  work properly.

KineticRequest_Approval_Create_V2 (2010-03-18)
* Set the Approval Template Catalog Name parameter to default to the current
  catalog, but it can also be changed to use an approval form from another
  catalog.
* Added additional 'Validation Status' deferred variable to the node.xml file to
  represent the value of the completed approval submission validation status.
* Modified how OriginatingID and OriginatingID_Display are retrieved so that
  OriginatingID_Display is properly retrieved.
* Remapped the 'Form' attribute to properly populate based on the
  'Suvey_Template_Name' of the originating request.

KineticRequest_Approval_Create_V1 (2010-12-01)
* Initial version.  See README for details.
