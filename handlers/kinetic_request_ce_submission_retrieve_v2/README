=== Detailed Description
This handler retrieves a submission by either id or query. If retrieving by query, the handler
queries the given space/kapp/form in the form of q={inputted_query}. The query that is used to
return back a submission should be a query unique enough to bring back one record, although if it
is not unique the handler will not currently fail and will instead just return the first submission
returned. If searching by id, only the id needs to be inputted to return that submission.
