== Ars Models
The Ars Models Ruby package is a JRuby wrapper implementations of the Kinetic
Ars Models Java source classes, which simplify Ars interactions by exposing 
abstracted CRUD methods for common Ars objects.  The Ruby models wrap Java calls
to implement common Ruby paradigms, such as a method accepting a hash of
options, and to convert the results from Java to Ruby datatypes.

* Java 1.5+
* JRuby version 1.1.4+

The Ars Models Ruby package is deployed using SVN.

  $ svn co https://svn9.cvsdude.com/KineticData/arsModels/trunk

To checkout and install the project gem, run the following commands:
  $ svn co https://svn9.cvsdude.com/KineticData/arsModels/trunk/pkg
  $ gem uninstall ars-models # Do this only if ars-models is already installed
  $ gem install pkg/ars-models-$VERSION$.gem
