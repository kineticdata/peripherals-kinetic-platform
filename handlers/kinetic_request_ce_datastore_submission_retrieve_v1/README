=== Detailed Description
This handler retrieves a datastore submission by either id or query. If retrieving by query, the
query parameter allows anything that can be passed into the query parameter in the datastore
submissions endpoint of the Request CE API (including the q= parameter). Before being sent to the
Request CE instance, the query is escaped by running the URI.escape() command on the inputted query
string. The query that is used to return back a submission should be a query unique enough to bring
back one record, although if it is not unique the handler will not currently fail and will instead
just return the first submission returned. If searching by id, only the id needs to be inputted to
return that submission.
