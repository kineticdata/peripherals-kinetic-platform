=== Detailed Description
	Creates a submission using the information provided, sending a message using the
	message template to the submitter if one is provided.
	
	This should be (usually) used in conjunction with an answer create handler or
	an attribute set answer. This handler just creates a submission. It sets no 
	Attributes1-60 nor does it create any answers at all for that submission. At the
	time the v1 of this handler was created, it is recommended that this be used 
	with the Kinetic Request Submission Update Answers (v4) handler because this
	handler both creates answers and creates/updates the mappings for those answers
	to the correct attributes.
