== Description

This handlers uses the CSV file attached to the specified Customer Survey Instance ID
of the template with Survey Template Instance ID in the question CSV File and processes
the attributes listed in Attribute List for all rows of the csv. One of the columns in 
the CSV *must* be called Service Item Name and this must contain the Service Item name
for that row. 

If the handler can't match the Service Item Name to an existing template, it will skip 
that row and continue on. If the handler can't match an attribute in Attribute List with
an Attribute Type in the system, the handler will skip that column and continue on. The
handler will only process columns for attributes in Attribute List even if there are 
other columns in the file. 

Note: This handler does not check for existing attributes. If an attribute already exists
and allows multiple, this will create a duplicate. If the attribute already exists and
doesn't allow multiple, this handler will fail.

NOTE: This handler expects the service item name(s) to be unique on the system, not just in
a catalog. Changes will have to be made if this is not the case.
